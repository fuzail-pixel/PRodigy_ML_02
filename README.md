K-means clustering algorithm to group customers

#### overview
The objective is to implement a K-Means clustering algorithm for grouping customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. 
This clustering can provide valuable insights for personalized marketing strategies, customer targeting, and overall business decision-making.
It uses the customers' annual income and spending score to create clusters and visualizes the results.

#### Dataset
The dataset containing customer information, including features like 'Age,' 'Annual Income,' and 'Spending Score.'.

#### Technologies Used:

1.pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
2.NumPy: Library used for numerical operations and data handling.
3.Matplotlib: Library for data and image visualization, here used for visulaing results.
4.scikit-learn: Provides machine learning tools for building regression models, feature scaling, and polynomial feature generation.
5.Python: The primary programming language for the entire solution.
6.Seaborn:for plotting.

#### Project Outcome

1.Optimal Clusters: 5 clusters were determined as optimal for customer segmentation.
2.Insights: The analysis revealed distinct customer segments, aiding in targeted marketing efforts and personalized customer engagement.

#### Conclusion:
The code demonstrates the application of K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score. 
The visual representation allows for the identification of distinct customer segments. 
Further analysis or targeted marketing strategies can be devised based on the identified clusters. 
The code provides a straightforward example of using clustering techniques for customer segmentation.
